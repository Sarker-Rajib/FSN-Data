            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>The reproductive system is a collection of internal and external organs —in both males and females —that work together for the purpose of procreating. Only system not essential to sustaining life. 
               Due to its vital role in the survival of the species, many scientists feel that the reproductive system is among the most important systems in the entire body. 
               Gonads produce gametes Male gametes are sperm.
               Of the body's major systems, the reproductive system is the one that differs most between sexes, and the only system that does not function until puberty. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="pt-3 text-center">MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</h2>
            <p>Organ/component of this system :</p>
            <h3>1. Internal Organ</h3>
            <ol>
               <li><p>Testes :
                  Testes or testicles are two organ that hang inside the scrotum. From puberty on, the testicles produce sperm every day. The testes also produce male sex hormones, mainly testosterone, that in turn produce male secondary sex characteristics, such as pubic hair growth, facial hair, and deepening of one's voice. 
            
                  Sperm Count : a man will produce roughly 525 billion sperm during his whole lifetime and close to 1 billion per month. There are around 200 - 500 million sperm in an average in a single human ejaculation.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Epididymis: 	
                     The epididymis is a small, tightly-coiled tube about 20 feet long that is attached to the top and to the back of each testicle. Immature sperm cells move from the testicles into the epididymis, where they finish maturing and are stored temporarily. It takes about twenty days for the sperm to mature, becoming both mobile and fertile. They are stored in the epididymis for up to six weeks. During ejaculation, the epididymis expels sperm into the vas deferens. If ejaculation does not occur after six weeks, the sperm are absorbed into the body. Produces a fluid that neutralizes the acidity and provides lubrication. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p> Vas deference: 
                     The vas deferens are an extension of the epididymis. They are coiled tubes that carry sperm from the testes, over the bladder, past the seminal vesicles and to the urethra. The seminal vesicles are pouches that attach to the vas deferens near the bladder. They produce a fluid that provides sperm with an energy source. During male sterilization, the vas deferens are cut or sealed to prevent sperm from entering the urethra. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Seminal Vesicle
                     The seminal vesicles are paired ductal structures on the posterior-lateral aspect of the base of the bladder and secrete fluid that will form part of the semen. This fluid contains proteins, enzymes, mucus, and nutrients such as fructose. The two seminal vesicles contribute approximately 60 percent of the fluids passed from the human male during ejaculation. 
               </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Prostate Gland
                     The prostate gland is a firm structure located below the bladder. It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds the urethra as it leaves the bladder. The prostate produces a milky colored, alkaline substance that makes up the largest part (60%) of seminal fluid. This substance help s to activate and trans port the sperm. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Urethra
                     The urethra is a tube located in the center of the penis. It is the pathway that urine and semen travel through to exit the body. A man cannot ejaculate and urinate at the same time, as the opening of the bladder stays closed during ejaculation so that urine stays in the bladder. 
               </p>
               </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>
               2. External organ
            </h3>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>	Penis
                     The penis is a sexually sensitive organ made of spongy tissue, blood vessels, and many nerve endings. It contains the urethra, the pathway that urine and semen travel through to exit the body. The penis has a root, body (shaft), and glans. The root of the penis attaches it to the pubic arch. The body is the visible, pendant portion. When sexually excited, the penis fills with blood and becomes harder and larger; this is called an erection. 
                     --Glans Penis: The glans is the sensitive, rounded, head of the penis. A loose fold of skin (the foreskin) covers the glans, or head of the penis, and provides sexual sensation. Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin and an important aspect of some religions and cultures. It is normal for a penis to be either circumcised or not circumcised. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>	Scrotum
                     The scrotum is a sack of skin that hangs between the legs and behind the penis. It is divided internally into two parts, left and right, each containing one testicle. The left side of the scrotum usually hangs down a little more than the right. The scrotum helps to maintain the ideal temperature for normal sperm development by contracting and relaxing to move the testicles closer to the body for warmth or farther away to cool the temperature. </p>
               </li>
            </ol>

            <p>There are three hormones that regulate the male reproductive system:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormone stimulates the production of sperm.
                  </li>
               <li>Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the production of testosterone.
               </li>
               <li>Testosterone stimulates the development of male secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm.
               </li>
            </ol>

            <div>
               <h3>Sermatogenesis (sperm Production) :</h3>
               <p>Spermatogenesis is an ongoing differentiation process that occurs in the seminiferous epithelium in the testis in males to produce spermatozoa (sperm) and is sustained by a  tissue-specific stem cell termed the “spermatogonial stem cell.” 
               </p>

               <h4>Three Phases of Spermatogenesis :</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Mitosis (Mitosis of spermatogonium) and cell division (cytokinesis):
                     - Process producing two identical daughter cells Since daughter cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes (or two sets of chromosomes), they are called diploid. In seminiferous tubules, stem cells undergo mitosis 
                  </li>
             
        
                  <li>Meiosis
                     - Special form of cell division involved in gamete production. Two cycles of cell division (meiosis I and II) happen. Produces four haploid(haplo, single) cells, each with 23 individual chromosomes.
                        Synapsis
                           - Corresponding material and paternal chromosomes associate to form 23 chromosome pairs. Set of four chromatids is called a tetrad 
                  </li>      
         
                  <li>Spermiogenesis: 
                     - Differentiation of immature male gametes into physically mature spermatozoa.

               </h2>
               <h3>1. Internal Organ</h3>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <p>Ovaries:
                        Ovaries are where the egg cells (ova) grow and develop. There are two ovaries, each about the size and shape of an almond!. The ovaries are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Beginning in puberty, Follicle-stimulating hormone supports the growth of egg cells each month. About two weeks before menstruation, ovulation occurs. Ovulation is the process of an egg leaving one of the ovaries. The ovaries produce estrogen, progesterone and androgens.
                     -Estrogen regulates the menstrual cycle and supports the development of secondary sex characteristics, such as breast development and pubic hair growth. It also affects many other parts of the body, including the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, and the brain.
                     -Progesterone readies the endometrium to support a fertilized egg, should conception occur. If pregnancy does not occur, the progesterone levels in the body decrease, causing menstruation. During pregnancy, progesterone prevents premature uterine contractions and prepares the breasts for milk production. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p> Fallopian Tubes:
                        The fallopian tubes (uterine tubes or oviducts) connect the ovaries and the uterus. If an egg is fertilized by a sperm cell within about 24 hours after ovulation, the fertilized egg will travel along the fallopian tube for about seven days until it reaches the uterus for implantation. If the egg is not fertilized, the egg will dissolve in the fallopian tube. These are the tubes that are blocked when female sterilization is performed. Scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can be caused by chlamydia and gonorrhea infection. This can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterine cavity, most often in a fallopian tube. This can be life-threatening to a woman if not detected early. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p> Uterus:
                        The uterus (womb) is a hollow organ. A fallopian tube extends from each side of the uterus. The uterus is made up of muscular walls, an inner lining called the endometrium, and a cervix. It is located in the pelvis between the bladder and the rectum. The uterus plays a role in three important functions: menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth. The endometrium, or lining of the uterus, responds to changing hormone levels throughout a menstrual cycle. It gets thicker to provide nutrients for a fertilized egg to implant and grow. If implantation doesn't happen, then the top layers of the endometrium shed as menstrual bleeding, while the deeper layers remain to rebuild for the next cycle. If the uterus receives a fertilized egg, it provides an environment for the fertilized egg to develop into a fetus and then the fetus to grow throughout pregnancy. Before the first pregnancy, the uterus is about the size and shape of a pear, with the narrow portion directed down toward the vagina. After childbirth the uterus is usually larger and it regresses after menopause. 
                  </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>   Cervix:
                        The cervix is the lower part of the uterus where it joins the vagina. The cervix opens to allow passage of the baby out of the uterus during labor. Different types of normal, healthy secretions are produced here. These secretions change throughout the month. Sometimes they are white and sticky, sometimes they are clear and stretchy. Through the opening of the cervix, menstrual blood and other secretions pass from the uterus, into the vagina, and out of the body. Cervical mucus is a healthy secretion and a sign of fertility. A few days after the menstrual period ends, the genitals begin to secrete fluids. As the days go by, the amount of wetness increases. After ovulation, the genital wetness begins to decrease and dry up, until the next cycle. The pap test (pap's smear - Papanicolaou stain) screens for cancer of the cervix. The test is done by swabbing cells on the cervix. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>    Vagina:
                        The vagina is a muscular tube-like structure that extends from the cervix of the uterus to the outside of the body. It is located between the rectum and the bladder. The vagina provides sexual sensation due to its many nerve endings, especially in the outer third. It is three inches long when not aroused and five to six inches long when aroused. The vagina produces fluid daily to cleanse and lubricate itself and help sperm travel. The vagina serves as a passageway for menstrual flow. It is very stretchy and can expand during sexual arousal and during childbirth to allow a baby to leave the body. Mid-cycle, after ovulation, the amount of vaginal discharge begins to decrease until the next cycle. Sometimes people use the word vagina incorrectly to refer to all of the female genitals.</p>

               </ol>

               <h3>2. External organ</h3>
               <p>The external female genital area is made up of many parts, which together are called the vulva. 
               </p>

               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <p>   Clitoris: 
                        The clitoris is a small, sexually sensitive organ full of nerve endings and composed of erectile tissue. It is located at the front of the vulva where the labia minora meet. The clitoris becomes engorged with blood during sexual excitement, providing sexual sensation. 
                  </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>   The labia majora and labia minora:
                        The labia majora and labia minora surround the vaginal opening. protect the urethral opening and vagina. The labia majora are covered with pigmented skin and hair on the outer surface of the vulva and are smooth and free from hair on the inner surface. They are made up of fat and glands. The labia minora are protective covering over the clitoris and urethral opening. 
                  </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>   Vaginal opening :
                        The vaginal opening connects the female external and internal reproductive parts. It is the middle of three openings, between the urethral opening and anus. The urethra is the pathway urine travels through to exit the body. The anus is the opening through which feces leave the body. Technically, the anus is not part of the reproductive system. The vaginal opening is completely separate from the urethral opening and anus. Menstrual blood and other secretions pass from the uterus through the opening of the cervix, into the vagina, and out through the vaginal opening. The hymen is a mesh of fibers that surrounds or partly covers the vaginal opening. Appearance of the hymen does not accurately or reliably reflect sexual activity or experience. Some girls are born without a hymen, or it may be stretched during use of a tampon, sports, insertion of a finger or medical instrument, or during sexual activity. Some hymens are elastic enough to stretch without rupturing, even with intercourse. Hormonal changes throughout the life course affect the anatomy of the hymen, so its appearance changes over time. While all parts of the vulva contribute to sexual arousal (excitement and sensation) and orgasm, pregnancy can occur without having an orgasm.

            <div class="menstuation">
               <h3>Menstrual cycle </h3>
               <p>
                  The menstrual cycle begins on the first day of bleeding (period) and ends the day before the next period begins. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Menstrual cycle length varies from person to person, with a normal range from 23-35 days, if not pregnant. That means having a period every 23 days is normal or getting a period every 35 days is normal. Anything outside that range should be evaluated by a medical provider, unless there is a known reason (for example, due to their birth control method). The average age of the first period, called menarche, is 12-13 years, but menarche may normally occur between 8 and 15 years of age. For the first few years after menarche, the menstrual cycle may be irregular. Menstrual cycles are often irregular during adolescence, particularly from the first to second cycles. Click on the image below to learn more about the phases of a normal menstrual cycle. 
               </p>
               <h4>Phases of Menstrual Cycle :</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <p>Menstrual Phase (Menstruation): This is the time in the cycle when the uterine lining (endometrium) breaks down, causing a period. While most periods last for three to five days, a period lasting only two days to as many as seven days is still considered normal. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Follicular Phase: This is the time in the cycle when estrogen rises and the uterine lining (endometrium) begins to build up. This phase usually lasts from days six to ten. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Ovulatory Phase: This is the time in the cycle when estrogen peaks and an egg is released from the ovary (ovulation). During days 11-14, one of the developing follicles will form a fully mature egg (ovum). On about day 14, a sudden increase in luteinizing hormone causes the ovary to release its egg. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Luteal Phase: This is the time in the cycle when the egg travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus. The progesterone hormone increases, causing the uterine lining (endometrium) to thicken, preparing to receive a fertilized egg. Pregnancy occurs if the egg becomes fertilized by a sperm and attaches itself to the uterine wall. If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop and the uterus contracts, preparing to shed the built-up uterine lining. </p>
                  </li>
               </ol>

               <h4>Menopause </h4>
               <p>Menopause is the time in life when changes in hormones cause many changes in the body, including causing menstrual periods to stop. It is considered menopause after periods have stopped for 12 months in a row. 
                  The transition to menopause, called perimenopause, usually starts in the mid-to-late 40s. Perimenopause can last between two and eight years but usually lasts about four years. During perimenopause the body's production of estrogen and progesterone, two hormones made by the ovaries, varies greatly. Symptoms of menopause include vaginal dryness, hot flashes, chills, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, weight gain, and slowed metabolism. Encourage clients to talk to their health care providers if their symptoms are concerning. Remind them that it is still possible to become pregnant during perimenopause, so contraception is still important, if desired. </p>

            <div class="ovulation">
               <h3>Ovulation
               </h3>

               <p>Ovulation is the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary.  After it's released, the egg moves down the fallopian tube and stays there for 12 to 24 hours, where it can be fertilized.</p>
               <p>A part of the brain called the hypothalamus controls ovulation and the release of hormones during the menstrual cycle. The hypothalamus sends signals instructing the anterior lobe and pituitary gland to secrete luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).</p>
               
               <h5>Signs</h5>
               <p>The female reproductive system sends signals that ovulation is happening. These include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>The cervical mucus changing to resemble egg whites</li>
                  <li>an increase in body temperature</li>
                  <li>in some instances, pain</li>
               </ul>

               <p>A person might also experience:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>bloating</li>

               </h3>
               <p>Pregnancy is the term used to describe the period in which a fetus develops inside a woman's womb or uterus. Pregnancy usually lasts about 40 weeks, or just over 9 months, as measured from the last menstrual period to delivery. Health care providers refer to three segments of pregnancy, called trimesters </p>

                  Fertility Control:
               </h3>

               <p>
                  Human fertility is controlled by hormones , so fertility can be controlled using hormonal forms of contraception. The oral contraceptive, which is known as the pill, contains oestrogen or progesterone or a combination of both hormones. These hormones inhibit the production of FSH, and eggs cannot mature. 
               </p>

               <p>
                  What birth control options are available?
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Barrier methods. Examples include male and female condoms, as well as the diaphragm, cervical cap and contraceptive sponge.</li>
                  <li>Short-acting hormonal methods.</li>
                  <li>Long-acting hormonal methods.</li>
                  <li>Sterilization.</li>
